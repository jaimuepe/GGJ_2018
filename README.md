# Overcharge

**Overcharge** is a 2-player competitive game about two astronauts fighting for survival in a remote planet.

The objective is to destroy the enemy ship by throwing the energy core into it. By punching the core you can transfer part of your energy to increase its destructive power. You can also punch your enemy in the face, but be careful - you'll transfer your precious energy to them too!
